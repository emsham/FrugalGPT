# 🎓 FrugalGPT: Better Quality and Lower Cost for LLM Applications


The FrugalGPT framework offers a collection of techniques for _building LLM applications with budget constraints_.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can directly run the  [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LM-Wq-u87VI4TKM4thpnwepnOxTAtWaM?authuser=1#scrollTo=a95a1eec) to experience FrugalGPT. You don't even need API keys to get started with it.

Once you go through the notebook, you'll be ready to build your own LLM applcations with FrugalGPT! 


## 🔧 Installation
You can also install FrugalGPT locally by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/FrugalGPT
cd FrugalGPT
pip install git+https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/FrugalGPT
wget  https://github.com/lchen001/DataHolder/releases/download/v0.0.1/HEADLINES.zip
unzip HEADLINES.zip -d strategy/
rm HEADLINES.zip
wget -P db/ https://github.com/lchen001/DataHolder/releases/download/v0.0.1/HEADLINES.sqlite
wget -P db/ https://github.com/lchen001/DataHolder/releases/download/v0.0.1/qa_cache.sqlite
```
 

Now you are ready to use the [local intro notebook](intro.ipynb)!

For development, install the package from a local checkout:

```
pip install -e .
```

Provider SDKs are optional and loaded only when that provider is used:

```
pip install -e ".[ai21]"
pip install -e ".[anthropic]"
pip install -e ".[cohere]"
pip install -e ".[google]"
pip install -e ".[scoring]"
```

Run the lightweight test suite without API keys:

```
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Run the deterministic customer-support triage demo:

```
python examples/business_support_triage_demo.py
```

The demo uses local fake providers to compare a cheap-first cascade against a strong-model-only baseline before any live API spend.

Run the CSV-based business ticket eval:

```
python examples/business_ticket_eval.py \
  --input examples/business_tickets_sample.csv \
  --output /tmp/frugalgpt_ticket_eval.csv \
  --compare-strong-only
```

The output CSV includes predicted routing, cost, correctness columns, and blank human-review fields.
Input rows should include `ticket_id` and `text`; optional labels are `expected_category`, `expected_urgency`, and `expected_escalation`.

## 📣 Updates & Changelog

### 🔹 2025.02.09 - Evaluation on recent models

- ✅ Added support to Cluade 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and a few more models.

- ✅ Released evaluations with more recent models. For example, you can run the following colab notebook to evaluate the tradeoffs achieved on the AGNEWS dataset using 2024 model: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/stanford-futuredata/FrugalGPT/blob/main/examples/FrugalGPT_gen_tradeoff_AGNEWS2024.ipynb)

- ✅ Updated the paper and reference format


### 🔹 2024.09.18 - Provided tradeoffs evaluation examples

- ✅ Provided tradeoffs evaluation examples. For example, you can run the following colab notebook to evaluate the tradeoffs achieved on the SCIQ dataset: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/stanford-futuredata/FrugalGPT/blob/main/examples/FrugalGPT_gen_tradeoff_SCIQ.ipynb)


### 🔹 2024.09.10 - Added support to more recent models

- ✅ Added support of a few new models. This includes proprietary models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4-Turbo, and GPT-4o-mini, and a few open-source models such as Llama 3.1 (405B), Llama 3 (70B) and Gemma 2 (9B)
- ✅ Released prompts and in-context examples used for SCIQ

### 🔹 2024.01.01 - Extracted API generations 

  - ✅ Added the generations from 12 commercial LLM APIs for each dataset evaluated in the paper
  - ✅ Included both input queries and associated parameters (e.g., temperature and stop token)
  - ✅ Released them as CSV files [here](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/FrugalGPT/releases/tag/0.0.1)
